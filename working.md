- **Rowhammer-based Memory Attacks and Defenses**
    - Implemented a tool to reverse-engineer DRAM address mappings across diverse CPU microarchitectures
    - Exploited page-table walks to perform rowhammer attacks, enabling controlled bit-flips for privilege escalation
    - Conducting research on kernel-level program exploitation, exploring cross-privilege boundary vulnerabilities

- **Rule Conflicts Detection and Resolution**
    - Developed a comprehensive framework leveraging logic reasoning to detect and resolve rule conflicts
    - Formalized event relationships and systematically identified event interferences to categorize rule conflicts
    - Employed model checking and SMT solving techniques to identify potential rule conflicts
    - Implemented a genetic algorithm-based method to resolve detected rule conflicts efficiently
    - Provided a GUI integrating real-world environmental factors and physical constraints

- **Privacy Leakage Detection**
    - Identified a novel cross-app privacy leakage risk in IoT apps and conducted a systematic study on inference threats
    - Formalized cross-app chaining problems and defined trigger-condition-action relations to model interactions between apps
    - Inferred device profiles based on usage context, ensuring accurate modeling for devices with varying sensitivity levels
    - Quantified privacy inference probabilities to assess both direct exposure and implicit inference risks
    - Developed a GUI to provide users with visual insights into privacy risks and enable better decision-making

- **Large-Scale Real-World IoT App Dataset**
    - Collected and cleaned a large-scale dataset of real-world open-source IoT apps from diverse sources
    - Filtered out invalid apps using regular-expression matching and symbolic execution techniques
    - Eliminated identical and near-duplicate apps by computing fuzzy hashes and applying clustering algorithms
